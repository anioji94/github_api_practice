# github_api_practice

I'll be using the github API to pull a GitHub user's favourite language.

## Goals
1. Use the GitHub API to pull the information

2. Practice my FrontEnd by making a nice interface with HTML, CSS and JS

3. Responsive web design rules should allow my app to work on a smartphone

4. Deploy app via Heroku.

```
As a developer
So that I can know what languages other developers like
I want to pull that dev's favourite language

As a developer
So that I can confirm my app's ability to work
I'd like to be able to use it in the command line

As a user
So that I can enjoy using the app
I'd like to have a pretty interface
```
